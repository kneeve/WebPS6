Time Out Value:
I primarily picked a value that I knew would be long enough for everything that I needed to get done would occur.
I also found it valuable to make sure the wait time was not too long so that I (and TA's who will
be doing the grading) do not have wait ages for something to be found. I found that in many place, I had to 
add a thread.sleep in order to allow pages to load. Otherwise I would encounter an error saying that the
element could not be found.

Thought on Selenium:
I believe that Selenium was actually very straightforward to use. I enjoyed the syntax because I found
that it made coding Selenium a lot easier to use. I enjoyed this assignment quite a bit because of learning how to 
use Selenium. I also found it extremely useful to be able to see exactly what Selenium was doing. To watch your code
click buttons and search results was fascinating and pretty entertaining to say the least. 

The downside to using Selenium was that it could be pretty slow since it was manually running these commands on a webpage.
This means that you would have to have built in commands to tell the program to wait for a couple seconds to allow features
to load on the webpage. Otherwise, I found the assignment using Selenium enjoyable and fun to learn. Selenium is a really 
neat tool that I see myself using in the future.


Comment to Evaluators:
I added in a few "Thread.Sleep(####)" calls in my program. I hope not, but it may be necessary to change these in order to see everything work correctly.
